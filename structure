Structure
A structure is a composite data type that defines a grouped list of variables that are to be placed under one name in a block of memory. 
It allows different variables to be accessed by using a single pointer to the structure

syntax   
        -struct structure_name   
{  
    data_type member1;  
    data_type member2;  
    .  
    .  
    data_type memeber;  
};  
Advantages
It can hold variables of different data types.
We can create objects containing different types of attributes.
It allows us to re-use the data layout across programs.
It is used to implement other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc.

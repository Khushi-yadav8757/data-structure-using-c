classifications of data structure
Primitive Data Structure
Non-Primitive Data Structure

Primitive Data Structures are the data structures consisting of the numbers and the characters that come in-built into programs.
These data structures can be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
Basic data types like Integer, Float, Character, and Boolean come under the Primitive Data Structures.
These data types are also called Simple data types, as they contain characters that can't be divided further

Non-Primitive Data Structures are those data structures derived from Primitive Data Structures.
These data structures can't be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
The focus of these data structures is on forming a set of data elements that is either homogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data types).
Based on the structure and arrangement of data, we can divide these data structures into two sub-categories -
Linear Data Structures
Non-Linear Data Structures
